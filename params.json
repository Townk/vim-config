{"name":"Full Vim Configuration","tagline":"This is my full vim configuration","body":"# Full Vim Configuration\r\n\r\nWelcome to my full vim configuration!\r\n\r\nBefore you clone this project I would like to take some time to explain you my \r\ndecisions here and to try to warn you of possible problems you might face.\r\n\r\n## Plugin manager\r\n\r\nI'm still not convinced there is a good _automagic_ plugin manager yet, so for \r\nthe time being I'll continue to use \r\n[pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).\r\n\r\nNotice that I mentioned the words '_yet_' and '_for the time being_'. This means \r\nthat I am looking into automatic plugin managers but I still didn't decided \r\nwhich one is better and what advantages it might give me over the full control I \r\nhave with pathogen.\r\n\r\n## Target audience\r\n\r\nAnyone can use and modify my configurations in any way needed. I would only \r\nsuggest that you 1) give me credit for something interesting you find here and \r\n2) share your changes so other could benefit from it.\r\n\r\nThat being said I would like to point out that I work as a software engineer so \r\nmost of my configurations are target for that kind of work.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou can use this in any way you prefer but I would like to show you how I use \r\nit in my machines.\r\n\r\n1. Clone this project on any directory;\r\n2. Initialize the submodules;\r\n3. Link the `vimrc` and `gvimrc` files to your home directory with a `.` \r\n   prepended;\r\n4. Link the directory `vim` to your home directory with a `.` prepended;\r\n\r\nLike this:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ mkdir -p ~/Projects/vim\r\n$ cd ~/Projects/vim\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/Townk/vim-config.git\r\n$ cd vim-config\r\n$ git submodule update --init --recursive\r\n$ ln -sf ~/Projects/vim/vim-config/vimrc ~/.vimrc\r\n$ ln -sf ~/Projects/vim/vim-config/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc\r\n$ ln -sf ~/Projects/vim/vim-config/vim ~/.vim\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** I only tested these configurations on Unix environments. You'll see \r\nsome Win32 checks here but I can't guarantee this will work perfectly on \r\nWindows, so use at your own discretion.\r\n","google":"UA-21368777-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
